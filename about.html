                	<h1>About Me</h1>
                		<p>A native of Puerto Rico, I currently reside in Harrisburg, PA. Initially starting my post-college career as an account manager with an interest in public policy, I soon became intrigued by web development. That curiosity opened a door. The excitement that coarsed through me as I tediously worked through my first few lines of code was unprecedented. </p>
                		<p>I realized that I had I found something which gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. I am in the midst of making a full change to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code. When not coding, you can find me cruising down the side of a mountain on my snowboard, playing basketball, or practicing my guitar.</p>
